# Project-Documentation-for-UChicago
This documentation and the accompanying files were submitted to the University of Chicago as part of the review process for the MS in Applied Data Science program.

-1.	Read in the official Madison weather data and manipulate the different data types. 
 
-2. (Visualization) Display the density functions of these two distributions, using blue for normal and red for t.
- Add colored (using the same color scheme) dashed vertical lines at the corresponding 0.975 quantiles.
- Shade the area in tail areas below the 0.025 and above the 0.975 quantiles of each distribution, setting `alpha = 0.5` for partial transparency. 

-3. Design my own function: Calculate the annual average temperature manually. Show my understanding of the function design ability.
